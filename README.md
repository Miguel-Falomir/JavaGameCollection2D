# Java Game Collection 2D

A humble collection of 8 rip-offs of some of the most famous games in computers' history.
This project is merely for portfolio purposes, and focused on the process itself rather than the final result (hence the implementation of Swing instead of JavaFX).
All the features have been implemented in stock openjdk-17, without any kind of plugin or dependency.

## Contributing

Please don't. Programming is nearly as personal as hand-written calligraphy or fingerprints.
You are free to download source code and tune it to your own version (as far as the MIT license allows), but I wouldn't like others to see your contribution and think that I write code like that.
Keep your own style, and let me keep my own.
